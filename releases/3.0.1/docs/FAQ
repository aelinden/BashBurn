FAQ for BashBurn (Magma):
=================


Q1:	Why?
A1:	I felt like it. Well, I got sick of a program I used always failing
	to burn audio cds, and since I don't know how to program C or something 
	I decided to write a simple little shell script to do the job.

Q2:	What can BashBurn do?
A2:	BashBurn can burn data, music and multisession CDs/DVDs.  It can burn and
	create ISO files. It can burn bin/cue files, create MP3s, OGGs and FLAC
	files. Maybe even more :-) In short, it can do most things you need, and 
	if it can't you're probably doing it wrong. ;-)

Q3:	You/BashBurn/Ya mama/Vacuum machines suck!
A3:	That's not a question.

Q4:	Why the namechange?
A4:	Apparently there already was a program named Magma, so a namechange was 
	a must.	I agree BashBurn isnt really a kickass name, but hey! At least it 
	can still get the work done...

Q5:	Can I steal the code and base my own programs on it?
A5:	Yes. Can't imagine why anyone would want to, but sure. Just remember
	to release your program under the GPL, and leaving the credits would
	be nice.

Q6:	Can I help?
A6:	Sure! Code away and send me the patch. If I find it worthy (Which I do most of the times)
	I'll include it in the next release and add you to the credits file.

Q7:	How do I install BashBurn?
A7:	Read the INSTALL file dummy!

Q8:	BashBurn often failes to write CDs.
A8:	Well I bet it isn't really BashBurns fault. Could be that your system
	isn't fast enough. Try to reduce the speed of your burner, or buy
	higher quality CDs. If your burner supports it, try using 
	burnfree/burnsafe. Of course it COULD be BashBurn failing, in which case 
	it's a bug. Send me a mail with a description of the problem and I'll try
	to fix it as soon as possible.

Q9:	I try to create an ISO-file from files in my harddrive, but all files
        from different directories end up in the root, not in their respective
        directories!
A9:	Yes, this is a known bug in Magma versions before 1.0. If you are using
	a version that old you should be taken out back and put down.
	You could also try to download a newer version.

Q10:	Who are you?
A10:	A little geek from Sweden, and thats all you need to know. :-)

Q11:	How do I use driver options?
A11:	You don't really have to, but if you want to try it out, here is how. 
	Under configure, choose driver options and BashBurn will show what your 
	burner supports. My burner supports burnfree, so I enter burnfree and 
	press enter. The next time I burn a cd, BashBurn will enable burnfree to 
	prevent buffer underruns. You can enter	several options by separating 
	them with a comma.

Q12:	BashBurn cannot find my cd-burner. What do I do?
A12:	Make sure that you have support for your burner in the kernel. For IDE 
	burners you can either use SCSI emulation or ATAPI mode. (Check Q18) If 
	you don't know how to configure your kernel, use google (There is lots of 
	good info on the web), tldp.org or #linuxhelp on irc.freenode.org

Q13:	Where do I report bugs? Where do I find any help?
A13:	Join the mailinglist and report it there, or send me a mail.

Q14:	When will Magma 2 be released?
A14:	It wont. Magma doesnt exist anymore, remember? We'll see what happens in 
	the future, for now BashBurn is what you have to settle with.

Q15:	Does BashBurn support for instance overburn?
A15:	Yes, though it's not really tested that much. Try it out, and if it works, 
	great, let me know. If it doesn't work, crap, let me know.

Q16:	I can't mount my ISO and view it. What's wrong?
A16:	Make sure you have support for loopback devices in your kernel
	or compiled as a module and loaded. If you're not root, make sure
	you are part of the sudoers group, since BashBurn uses sudo when 
	mounting the image in that case.

Q17:	I ran Install.sh as root, but I still cant start BashBurn as a regular user
A17:	Download and install BashBurn 1.0 or later. In those versions the installation 
	script is rewritten and works a lot better.

Q18:	Does BashBurn support IDE burners natively, or do I need to use SCSI emulation?
A18:	As from BashBurn 1.3, IDE burners should work just fine. I use this myself 
	and have not experienced any problems so far. To be able to use this you 
	will need a 2.6 Linux kernel, cdrtools version 2.0 or higher and 
	BashBurn 1.3 or higher.

Q19:	Running BashBurn in sudo gives me an error.
A19:	The latest version of BashBurn should work fine in sudo. If it doesn't 
	tell me about it and I'll try to find a workaround. 
	
Q20:	Where is this mailinglist I've been hearing so mych about?
A20:	Go to http://bashburn.sf.net, click on the link that says "mailinglist" and
	follow the instructions there on how to sign up.

Q21:	Can BashBurn burn DVDs?
A21:	See A2

Q22:	How do I install BashBurn?
A22:	Read the INSTALL file.

Q23:	What are the requirements for BashBurn?
A23:	Check the webpage at http://bashburn.sf.net for info. 
	Once BashBurn is installed, you can also run option
	8 in the main menu, Check program paths to see if you
	need to install any programs for full functionality.
	(Note: In Ubuntu normalize is called normalize-audio)
