rpm creation for bashburn.

There are two files here (as we speak). The first is the spec file,
and the other is a script called mkbbsrpm.sh The way this works is
that you run the mkbbsrpm.sh script and the result is that you end up
with a .tar.bz2 file in your ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES directory and the spec
file in your SPECS directory. Then you just go to your SPECS
directory and run

rpmbuild -ba bashburn.spec

This will result in a .src.rpm in the SRPMS dir and a .noarch.rpm in
the RPMS/noarch dir.
