BashBurn ChangeLog:
=================

BashBurn 3.0 (Tara)
- Major rewrites and cleanups. BashBurn should be faster, smaller
  and most of all cleaner.
- BashBurn now only uses a local configuration file.
- Advanced configuration menu added.
- Removed certain configuration options most people probably find 
  unnecessary.
- Default installation directory changed.
- Due to the rewrites, ~/.bashburnrc must be removed before starting
  BashBurn after installation. A new config file will be automatically
  created in the users home directory.
- Rewritten script for reading M3U playlists. Now supports several
  formats, not just MP3s.
- Added 'BashBurn_on_Fire' splash - kudos to http://ascii.mastervb.net/ for the template creation
- .bashburnrc now has a version line, checked at start up.  Version 2.x .bashburnrc will
  not work with BashBurn 3.x re-write.
- BashBurn now has a MAN page ( bashburn(1) )

BashBurn 2.1.2 (Scotty)
- Added DVD blanking (Santiago)
- Moved CDRW blanking to data menu

- Replaced cdda2wav with cdparanoia. CD copying rewritten
  in places due to this.
- Added simple cancel feature in configuration. Function check_length()
  checks if argument given is of length 0. If so, configure restores
  the old saved value. This way, one can simply press enter without entering
  anything and the configure script will interpret that as a cancellation.
- Added italian translation (Amedeo Grazia)

BashBurn 2.0 (Next Generation)
- Functionality split from interface to ensure
  that BashBurn and fork MyBashBurn can use same core code.

BashBurn 1.7.1 (Tigger)

- Changed setterm -clear to plain old clear
- Made sure menu text is shown if background is white

- Support for burning .img-files added

BashBurn 1.5.2 (Quantum Physics)
- Fixed a small mistake in audio_menu.sh (David Hall)

BashBurn 1.5.1 (I Am The Walrus)
- Fixed two little bugs, one with iso detection and one with multisession.
  (Some code really is a mess. When I have time one day a big cleanup is happening)  

BashBurn 1.5 (Gulledavid)
- CD copying in large parts rewritten with help from Jim. 
  Should work just fine (Does for me) but report any bugs you might find.
- Changed -P to -publisher for mkisofs. (Jim)
- data_menu.lang and configure.lang updated
- Removed some pretty useless options in the config script.
- Spanish translation removed since it's not updated. I will make it
  and all other translations available on the BashBurn homepage when I get them.

BashBurn 1.5 Beta 2 (Almost there)
- Moved some english text in BashBurn.sh to BashBurn.lang so it can be translated.
- DAO/TAO support. (Whether it works properly or not is another question)
- Changed single quotation marks to double quotation marks in translation files.
  Single ones caused some errors which double ones will probably prevent.
- Misc fixes

BashBurn 1.5 Beta 1 (Willy Nilly)
- Fix in burning.sh (Thanks to Justin for spotting it and Michele for the fix).
- Spanish translation added.
- Added check in BashBurn.sh to find out if BashBurn has ever been configured.
- BashBurn now supports different languages!
- Bug in install script fixed, plus some graphic touchups.
- Bug in data cd copying fixed.
- Misc other small fixes.

BashBurn 1.4 Final (Top of the foodchain)
- ISO mounting/editing removed. I didn't get it to work right and
  there is no point having something non-functioning there.
  If anyone desperately needs it, you write it!
- Minor change with mkisofs.
- Bugfix in the normalize function.
- Small bugfix in configure.sh (Wilmer).
- Mp3 encoding now uses the bitrate set in configuration (Wilmer).
- Some default values in bashburnrc changed.
- Fixed permissions issue with the config file.
- Rewrote install script. Now you don't have to keep the directory
  you unpacked BashBurn in.
- Removed files that were not supposed to be there.
- CD ripping now supports spaces in filenames (Wilmer).
- Documentation updates.

BashBurn 1.4 rc1
- After version 1.4 is released I'm going slow down BashBurn development for 
  a while. I have too much schoolwork at the moment. Version 1.4 will not have 
  any new features, only bugfixes if I (or you) find any. New features will have
  to wait until version 1.5
- Added option in configure.sh. Just to make things difficult, certain apps
  needed the cdrom device to be entered as /dev/blah and others needed it to
  be entered as /mnt/blah. So, to avoid forcing the user to go back and forth
  to the configure menu and change this, I added a new option. Now we have
  cdrom device file (/dev/blah) and cdrom mount point (/mnt/blah).
- Made some improvements to the mount.sh script.
- Small graphics touchup in the application checking script

BashBurn 1.3 - 1.4a2
- Removed the bash executable detection. According to Nicol Schraudolph this
  does not work at all. All of you that has your bash executable located in 
  a different place than /bin/bash might need to edit Install.sh and BashBurn.sh
  and enter the correct path manually. Once these changes are made however,
  everything should work fine.
- Small bugfix to the cd ripping.
- Update to delete files in BURNDIR function.
- FILES updated.
- Misc graphic touchups (Wilmer Jaramillo, Jim Shofstall).
- Added functions in audio_menu (Wilmer Jaramillo).
- Added nice "interactive mode" to name the tracks when ripping oggs and mp3s.
  Still cannot handle spaces in names, but that will come later (Wilmer Jaramillo).
- alpha1 missed flac in check_path.sh. This is added now.
- Added option to set bitrate of audio files in configure (Wilmer Jaramillo).
- Added a application search function in main menu. (Thanks Wilmer Jaramillo).
- Fixed a typo in configure.
- Once again, better audiofile handling. And this time it REALLY takes care of
  annoying error messages.
- Preliminary flac file support. If more advanced support is required, post a feature request
  or write a patch yourself and I'll apply it.

BashBurn 1.3
- Added confirmation when deleting files in BURNDIR
- Lots of small improvements on audio file handling
- "Graphic" touchups
- FAQ updated
- convert_oggs and convert_mp3s rewritten (Somewhat) and audio_menu changed. 
  This takes care of some rather annoying error messages that occured when trying
  to burn a music cd. (Happy now Matte?! Are you?)
- Lots of small fixes thanks to Jim Shofstall
- Changes in version display in several files
- Changed BashBurn homepage in BashBurn.sh
- Fixed misc bugs (Including the installation bug from 1.2)
- Replaced lots of references to Magma with BashBurn is various files.
- Writer device detection now supports IDE devices (New in Linux 2.6)
- Changed so that every script detects where the bash executable is located.
  This should make BashBurn work on for instance *BSD with bash installed.
  (I know that OpenBSD for one does not use the bash shell by default. However
  since BashBurn is a bash script, it would mean a more or less complete rewrite
  to make it work in other shells. If someone feels up to it, go ahead and do it
  and I will make that version available on the BashBurn homepage. In the meantime
  install bash)
- Some minor edits here and there

BashBurn 1.2
- BashBurn now also comes in Perl flavor. Thanks to 
  John Minson for writing it. (Well its not here yet, but hopefully soon)
- Replaced bincue.sh with rewritten one. (Thanks Pat)
- Minor fix in BashBurh.sh
- Added option to mount/unmount cdrom device in main menu
- Added file misc/mount.sh that takes care of the (un)mounting
- Fixed typo in iso_menu.sh that caused it to fail (Thanks Peter)
- Added some info in configure.sh. Apparently to use IDE burners without
  SCSI emulation you can just enter your burner as ATAPI:0,1,0 or similar
  to get BashBurn to use it. Thanks to Peter again for the info
  (Requires a version 2.6 Linux kernel and cdrtools 2.0+)
- Fixed some typos in multi.sh that caused it to fail
- Renamed .bashburnrc to bashburnrc in "source" directory. Dunno
  Why I had it hidden really...

BashBurn 1.1
- Changed some dd commands into mkisofs
  (This means you most likely have to configure BashBurn again and set your reader device
   to something like /mnt/dvd or /mnt/cdrom instead of the previous /dev/cdrom*)
- Removed some sleep commands and replaced them with wait_for_enter
- Big overhaul of data_menu.sh. Now it should actually work.
- Removed missed Magma.iso in multi.sh and replaced it with BashBurn.iso
- FAQ updated
- PLAN file removed

BashBurn 1.0
- Renamed project to BashBurn since there already was a program named Magma.
- Increased quality of encoded ogg-files
- Rewrote large parts of installation script. You must now run this
  as root first to install global config file. (/etc/bashburnrc)
- BashBurn.sh updated to reflect changes in installation script
NOTE: The installation script set permissions to rwrwrw on
      the config file.

Magma 1.4r3 (Dawn)
- Added a few more missed wait for enter functions in Magma.sh
- Documentation updates
- Removed some lines of code that did nothing

Magma 1.4r2 (Dawn)
- Some small bugfixes concerning finding ISO-files.
- Missed the -J option in some files. Now fixed.
- Added missed wait for enter funtions in some files.

Magma 1.4.0 (Dawn)
- Critical bugfix in Magma.sh (Thanks Jim)
- Added -J to mkisofs command to produce a joliet directory
  (For windows people)
- Minor change in listing files in $BURNDIR
- A bunch of code cleanups
- Updated installation script
- bin/cue script enhanced

Magma 1.3.1 (Dez)
- Slight edit in configure.sh
- Added preliminary support for burning bin/cue files. (Requires cdrdao)
  Not tested much, so if things don't work right send me a mail, 
  or if you feel like it send me a patch.

Magma 1.3.0 (Loco)
- Added file FILES and moved all id tags from other files to that one.
- Switched places between View BURNDIR and Clear BURNDIR.
  (Makes more sense this way)
- Fixed some issues with ISO creation.
- Moved the shellscripts into directories: configure.sh into config, 
  xmmsread.sh and mount_loop into misc, burning.sh and multi.sh into burning,
  convert_oggs.sh and convert_mp3s.sh into convert and finally menu files
  into menus. 
- Fixed issue in multi.sh
- Took care of another bug in direct audio burning that was forgotten in 1.2.4
- Added an option to configure.
- Made some improvements (IMHO) to configure.sh
- Fixed some bugs in mount_loop.sh that caused Magma to be unable to create
  a new ISO if the original ISO was changed. 
- Some updates here and there.

Magma 1.2.4 (Still Going Strong)
- Made driveroptions a little easier to understand.
- Updated audio_menu.sh. Newer version of cdrtools/cdrecord might be needed now.
- Fixed a typo that caused direct audio burning to fail. 
- And yeah, you might have noticed that even though I said that Magma 1.2.0 would be the
  the last release, I keep on releasing newer versions of Magma 1.x. This is because:
--> 1# I have no idea when M2 will be released.
--> 2# I have recieved a lot of mails lately from people telling me
       how much they like Magma. Thanks a lot, I didn't really think
       that many used this little app, but it seems like it's quite popular.
       With this in mind it would be kinda mean to just stop developing 
       something a lot of people use, so I guess I'll keep on releasing new
       versions a little now and then. 

Magma 1.2.3 (New World Order)
- Bugfix for the Install.sh bugfix. (Doh!)
- The Magma config file is now called .magmarc
- Code cleanups

Magma 1.2.2.2 (Blast off)
- Another small fix. This release takes care of a bug in Install.sh
  If you have no problems with 1.2.2.1, there is no need to upgrade.
	
Magma 1.2.2.1 (Bigger Bang)
- A small fix in xmmsread.sh (Thanks to Page for the fix.)

Magma 1.2.2 (Big Bang)
- Fixed some issues with file removal after burning.
- Higher quality when encoding .ogg files. (1.0 released! Hooray!)
- Ogg-file decompression now uses oggdec instead of the clumpsy ogg123 version.
- Added overburn functionality. Tell me if it works (Or not...)
- MagmaChangelog renamed to ChangeLog
- Some cleanups. Since my trusty CDRW disc crapped out on me, I can't check if something is broken.
  Send me a bugreport if something doesn't work.

Magma 1.2.1 (Quasar)
- Minor code enhancements
- Added option in configure
- Ok, I was supposed to add these features into 1.2.0 but somehow
  I forgot them. Anyways, THIS should be the final release in the
  1.x series.

Magma 1.2.0 (Galactica)
- Added function to create Mp3s and oggs from a CD, without having to first
  rip the cd and then compress the files.
- Some documentation updates.
- Code cleanup again...
- This is probably the last release in the 1.x series. Please report any bugs
  to connyosis@gmx.net so I or Tobias can fix them before the 2.0 release.

Magma 1.1.5 (Starburst)
- Install script rewritten.
- HOWTO added to website
- INSTALL updated
- Added function to create .ogg-files from wavs.
  (Yes again, not what Magma is supposed to do, but what the hell...)
- Added function to create audio cds from .ogg-file.
  (Changed the audio menu script a little and added a file.)  

Magma 1.1.4 (Supernova)
- Rewrote some parts of the xmms playlist script. It's a little smarter now.
- New multi.sh replaced the old one. This one (Written by Angles) is better.
- Removed the 10 second grace period before burning. Pretty useless since cdrecord
  itself has this.
- Some things easier to understand.
- A small and VERY simple installation script included. 
- HOWTO is rewritten.
- Magmas homepage is now http://freebits.de/magma

Magma 1.1.3 (Cap in Ya Dome)
- Added function to create Mp3s from Wavs. (Requires lame to be installed.)
  (Yes I know, this isn't what Magma is supposed to be doing, but MadMaN convinced me.)
- Made some options in configure easier to understand.
- Some minor code cleanups
- Added function to burn Xmms playlists. (This is a VERY simple script that for
  now pretty much sucks. You need write permissions to the directory where the
  mp3s are stored, and it's not very well written. I will rewrite this some day.
  Anyone want to rewrite it for me, please do.)
- RPM available of Magma 1.1.2

Magma 1.1.2 (Moulin Rouge must die)
- Removed some silly little checks that didn't work. Hopefully the average
  Magma user is intelligent enough to have a cd in the drive before attempting
  to burn something. Checks might be added into M2.
- Added option in main menu to view BURNDIR. Useful for making sure no vital files
  are accidently removed when clearing BURNDIR.
- Small documentation updates.
- Magmas homepage is now http://magma.dk3.com (Or http://medlem.spray.se/connymute)

Magma 1.1.1 (Elvis was Alive)
- Fixed an error in burning.sh that freaked out if more then one wav-file
  was present in BURNDIR. When will I learn to test this thing before releasing...

Magma 1.1 Final (Elvis is alive)
- Edited some parts of burning.sh that didn't work at all.
  Sorry about that, gotta be more careful when accepting patches.
  Something screwed up Magma so it found the files, but didn't actually
  burn anything. Fixed now.
- Removed the useless cddb lookup feature. Didn't work right anyways.
  If anyone wants to implement it, go ahead and then send me a patch,
  otherwise this will wait for Magma 2.0
- Commented code some more
- Changed a break to continue in iso_menu.sh
- Rewrote multi.sh, now it might actually work...
- Fixed an issue in Magma.sh that wouldn't remove files in BURNDIR when
  the option Clear BURNDIR was chosen.
- Fixed mistake in burning.sh
- The config-file .mconf mysteriously disappeared from ALPHA3. Now it's back.
- PLAN-file updated.
- Rewrite of Magma.sh and some new files added.
- Typo in mount_loop.sh taken care of
- Fixed a bug in convert_mp3s.sh that wouldn't find any files in BURNDIR
  if they were linked there, not copied.
- After adding some new functions we've decided to go in a
  new sub-version-tree.
- Some tuning up again and again.


Magma 1.0 020215
- Added function to copy cd to harddrive.
- Fixed issue with driver options (Thanks Christoffer Bruun).
- Added funtion for cddb lookup when copying cd audio to hd.
- Minor adjustments and code tuned up in various files.
- Bug in mount_loop.sh fixed. Now you can view
  the contents of several ISOs simultaneously.

Magma 1.0 (Hot Stuff)
- Freaking mkisofs bug is finally eliminated. Woohoo!
- Multisession supported.
- Support for driver options (for instance burnfree).
- Support for normalize.
- Changed new convert_mp3s.sh to old one. Works better.
- Support for forced blanking of CDRWs, if normal blanking should fail.

- Documentation updated.
- COPYING added
- Various small fixes and tune-ups.

###################################################################################
#WARNING: All version of Magma pre 1.0 has a nasty bug with mkisofs. It will cause#
#all files to end up in the same directory, instead of their respective one. We	  #
#strongly recommend you to use version 1.0 or later.				  #
###################################################################################

Magma 0.9.5 (Bugs R Us):
- We jumped to 0.9.5 directly.
- Issue with creating ISOs fixed. (mkisofs no longer cuts filenames.)
- More Issues with creating ISOs fixed.
- New function added to burn additional informations on a CD.
  (e.g. copyright, author, name of package and much more)

Magma 0.9.2pre2:
- README updated
- Some minor bugs fixed.
- New function added to view and modify the content of an ISO-file.
  (mount_loop.sh)
- Some minor things changed and added.

Magma 0.9.2pre1:
- Totally freaking rewritten by Tobias Rittweiler 
  (nice...does this mean I suck or what?)
- The configfile (mconf) has to be moved to the home-directory of
  the user who has execute Magma. So it has a firm location,
  I think it's better..
- That's why I changed all the $WORKDIR variable (in the beginning) to $HOME.
  And I changed the filename, so it's now '.mconf', because then it's
  hidden (like all the other configfiles)
- And I introduce a new variable $ROOTDIR - it's the path to the dir
  in that the shellscripts are. (so the installation is also different) 
- Also I changed the directory of temporary files. It's now '/tmp/burn' and
  so it's a real temp-dir, i think.
- I add also a small sed-liner, so now you can write spaces between the variables
  and the options in the conf-file. (the number of them doesn't matter.)
- Then I changed the colors of the table. And yeah, it looks fine.. :-) 
- The file convert_mp3.sh was absolutly written again by myself.
- I put all burn_*.sh files together in only one, because too much different
  files suck! So we've one that can all.. and that file is really bash!
- All files were rewritten, I tuned the code of them up, but i didn't write
  any extensions for it. That will coming soon..
- Rewrote the INSTALLATION, this ChangeLog, the HOWTO and the README.
- create_iso.sh and burning.sh now follows symlinks and allows more than one
  dot in the filenames when creating ISO-files.
- Burning is more verbose

Magma 0.9.1 (Titanic) 
- Added function to copy Audio and Data cds
- Added option to create ISO from files in BURNDIR

Magma 0.9.1pre3:
- Added option in configure menu
- Code cleanup

Magma 0.9.1pre2: 
- Changed from using cdparanoia for ripping audio cds to cdda2wav.
- Fixed audio-cd copying mistake. Forgot to sleep for 20 secs.
- Added cd-check for create_iso. No fake ISO is created if no cd
  is present in drive.
- Fixed small issue with main menu

Magma 0.9.0 (Everclear)
- Magma almost totally rewritten with a lot of help from Joel Wiesmann.
- Configuration menu added, now you don't have to edit the script yourself,
  enter your values in a simple menu.
- An option to clear BURNDIR was added. 

Magma 0.3.0/2 (Ringwraith)
- Menu redone again. Thanx to Joel Wiesmann for letting
  me test his nice program menubuilder.

Magma 0.3.0 (Phat Beat)
- Spaces in mp3-files bug fixed. (Thanks Olav Vitters)
- Menu redone

Magma 0.2.7/2 (Looney)
- Added a HOWTO for newbies

Magma 0.2.7 (Looney)
- Added option to create ISO-files from a cd.

Magma 0.2.6 (Katie) Dreamhack Edition
- Only some code cleanups and some documentation added.
  No need to get this one really if you're happy with 0.2.6 standard.

Magma 0.2.6 (Katie)
- Removed some silly things from burn_data and burn_iso that wasn't supposed 
  to be there in the first place.  
- It is now possible to blank CDRWs. Check top of Magma.sh for details.

Magma 0.2.5 (Idiot Box)
- Issues in 0.2.4 fixed. Code a little more commented.

Magma 0.2.4 (Slacker)
- Fixes some issues in 0.2.2 and adds the option to burn ISO-files directly.

Magma 0.2.2 (Mental)
- Magma can now burn data cds. Put all you data into BURNDIR, choose to burn a data cd 
  and voila! 

Magma 0.2.0/2 (Phreak)
- Silly little me forgot to remove -dummy from burn_audio_wav.sh
  This release includes that fix and some updates to the README file.

Magma 0.2.0 (Doodle)
- Deleted file burn.sh and updated burn_audio_wav.sh
- Fixed stupid bug where Magma would start burnprocess, even if no audiofiles
  where present in BURNDIR (Thanks Hampus Ram)
- Also Magma won't bail out if no Mp3s are present in BURNDIR. It simply
  continues and checks if wavs are there instead. 
  You could say this is the first version that is actually useful.

Magma 0.1.3
- New file, convert_mp3s.sh and removed burn_audio_mp3s.sh. 0.1.2 had a 
  nasty bug. To many Mp3s in BURNDIR caused Magma to spit out an error 
  message and quit, without burning.

Magma 0.1.2
- Magma can now burn audio cds directly with wav-files.
- burn.sh is divided into two files: burn_audio_mp3.sh and burn_audio_wav.sh
