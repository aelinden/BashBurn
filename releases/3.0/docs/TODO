BashBurn TODO file

LP = Low priority
MP = Medium priority
HP = High priority


*) Add cd text capabilities (LP) 

*) If a CDRW is already written, enable some kind of automatic blanking. (MP)
   (First of course warn about files being overwritten by the blanking.)

*) Split up configure script in two parts (LP)

*) Autodetection CD Recorder, useful for USB device (MP)

*) World domination (HP)

*) Anyone else have any suggestions?

---------------Aug 25 2008 11:05 Steve Orr-------------------
* Integrate configure menu with bbmenu. Add -c option to bbmenu. (HP)

* Move /usr/bin/BashBurn to /usr/lib/BashBurn (MP)

* loopback.sh calls cleanup which is not defined. (?)
  FIXED 080920: Should be loopback_cleanup of course. /Anders

* encode_filter only does something if ENCODEFILTER is not null. It
  is never set. (?)

* All global variables must be documented. If global variables are
  being used to pass parameters, they need to be removed and replaced
  with arguments. (HP)

* Global variables which are used to pass information back should
  be looked at to see if return values can be used. (MP)

* Audiofunc.sh has tons of duplicate code. Needs to be consolidated.
create_mp3s_from_wavs()
create_oggs_from_wavs()
create_flacs_from_wavs()
create_mp3s_from_cd()
create_oggs_from_cd()
create_flacs_from_cd() (LP)

* rm ${BBBURNDIR}/*.[Ww][Aa][Vv]
  needs to be replaced by setting shopt -s nocaseglob, or find -iname
  or grep -i
  func/multifunc.sh
  func/bincuefunc.sh
  func/isofunc.sh
  misc/xmmsread.sh
  convert/convert_flacs.sh
  convert/convert_oggs.sh
  convert/convert_mp3s.sh
  burning/burning.sh (MP)

* Add prefix option to Install
  Install.sh --prefix /usr/local
  to cause bb in /usr/local/bin
  and the rest in /usr/local/lib/BashBurn (LP)

* Consolidate use of color so Install and BB use common defs. (LP)

* Create color themes. (LP)

* Extract out config items that users should not be allowed to
  configure. (MP)
BBISCONF: 1
BBROOTDIR: /usr/bin/BashBurn
BBAUTHOR: <Change me>  # This should be in the README, no?
BBLANG: English # Should only be an override over the LANG variable.

* Let's figure out what utilities BB needs to be allowed to install
  and which utils are optional. (Q: Does bb not try to run things if
  the optional utils do not exist?) (HP?)

* Create a devel branch so people don't get shut down during
  development. (?)

* Create an rpm spec file and a deb package. (LP)

* Look for continue statements that are not in a loop. (LP)

* Add an option on the main menu to toggle command tracing. If tracing 
  is on, then the cdrecord commandset will be logged to the logfile
  and the commands will display on the screen. (LP)

* misc/xmmsread returns success but its caller, audio_menu/burn_xmms_playlist,
checks the status.

* misc/loopback.sh::loopback has a lots of farout return values that are 
 never looked at by the caller.

---------------Sep 4 2008 15:16 Steve Orr---------------
* Man page.
* cmdline option -c for alternate bashburnrc with envvar override
* ^C goes to top of current menu instead of exit.
* Define what components are mandatory for bb to start.
* lang subdirs should not be named in english. German should be
  Deutsch, etc.
* Remove maybe all of the cd commands that are all over the place.
* Move /usr/bin/BashBurn to /usr/lib/Bashburn
* Do we need a make install, make uninstall? Or do we want Install.sh
  -d?
* spec file to make an rpm?
* Put a header in ALL files that are sourced in from a subroutine.
* Move config functions to a more proper dir.

---------------Sep 6 2008 12:22 Steve Orr---------------
* Jimmy up the reads so that the only choices for what's available
  are in the readline history. (See HISTORY EXPANSION).

Sep 21 2008 16:00
* Create global vars for values for IFS
  + BBCONF_SEP (=':')
  + BBAVAL_SEP (='@')
  + BBCONFCH_SEP (='|')
