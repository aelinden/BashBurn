bashburn.template is the master template file with the text and MARKS for
formatting.
bashburn.sed is the script that creates the MAN page from bashburn.template
  this file contains the MARKS information that get created (it is pretty
  easy to understand when reading it).

So, to just edit text information, edit the text (not MARKS) in
bashburn.template.

To change any format (i.e. add sections, create sub-sections etc.) edit both
bashburn.template and bashburn.sed accordingly.

When all changes are done, issue:

make bashburn.1 
or just
make

You will now be looking at raw text of the man page in 'less'.  sed will report 
any errors so you can go back and fix them.

Additional targets include make clean, make bashburn.man and make bashburn.ps

The ps file is PostScript, suitable for printing. It can be viewed
with a PostScript viewer like evince or gv, etc. The .man file would be 
the same as if you ran the command:

man ./bashburn.1

As a note, this all looks a bit over the top, but by using this method,
anyone can maintain/correct the file text without having to know anything
about MAN macros and tags.
