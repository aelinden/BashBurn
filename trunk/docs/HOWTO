So, you downloaded BashBurn and now you want to burn a lot of CDs?
Well, if you've used BashBurn before, you can stop reading now and get
going. If not, take your time to read this little HOWTO.

INSTALLATION:

Check the file INSTALL for details.

CONFIGURATION:

After installing BashBurn, start it up by typing 'bashburn'.
The first time BashBurn will create a directory from where it will
read which files to be burnt.  Default is /tmp/burn. 
Now choose configure. You will be presented with a menu of options. 
Don't understand what they all mean? Don't worry, there is an
explanation for every one of them. If unsure, pick the default value,
it's often fine.
After you've gone through each option, choose Apply Settings. 
(Remember to do this or nothing will be saved.) 
Now choose Return to go back to the main menu.

USAGE:

BashBurn is designed to be as easy to understand as possible.
Let's say you want to burn an audio CD. Where do you go?
To Audio of course, and under Audio there are more options to choose from.
Just remember that before attempting a burn you must copy or link the
data or audio files to be burnt to the temporary burn directory,
which again by default is /tmp/burn. 

For example, let's say you want to burn an ISO file. 
1: Start BashBurn, pick option 10, define data.
2: Pick option 1, and follow instructions. Link the data 
   with 'ln -s /path/to/myfile.iso .' 
   (Without the ''. The dot is important)
   (You can also copy the data if you prefer that, 
   cp -Rf <data> <destination>)
3: Return to the main menu, choose ISO and pick the Burn ISO option. 
4: Done!
