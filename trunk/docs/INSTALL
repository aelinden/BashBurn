Installation

1. Unpack the file (And if you are reading this I guess you already did)
2. Cd into the directory and run the installation script (Install.sh)
   For options, run Install.sh --help
   (To do a global install that will affect all users on a system
    you will have to be root or have global write permissions)
3. Start the program by running 'bashburn' and configure it.
4. Enjoy!

Any problems mail me on anders.linden@gmail.com or post 
on the BashBurn mailinglist. Also check out the BashBurn
webpage at http://bashburn.dose.se for info and updates.
