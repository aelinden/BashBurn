README of BashBurn:
=================
BashBurn is released under the GNU GPL.

Once upon a time, or more exaclty sometime around December year 2001
if I'm not misaken, a young little nerd named Anders Lindén was trying
to burn some CDs with his recently bought CD-burner. He tried a lot of 
different programs, but for some reason it would just not work
properly. So, the little nerd thought to himself: "I guess I just have to do
something about this myself". And so he did...

The first versions of his program were not very good, or to be honest, 
they sucked. Bigtime. With time however more and more people found out 
about this little project of his and started to send in patches and 
suggestions to the little nerd. All was well.

Today, after lots of help from people all over 
(Check out the CREDITS-file for which ones) BashBurn is actually
pretty usable. It's not the most advanced cd burning app out there, but
it generally does it's job. A lot of people use BashBurn for simpler 
CD-burnings tasks and like it, so I hope you will as well.
