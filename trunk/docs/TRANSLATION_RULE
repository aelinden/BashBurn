BashBurn translation rules for translators
##########################################

There are 2 steps in translation process we must distinguish:

- ADD     (new) translation
- UPDATE  (existing) translation

Both steps are described below and each translator should know this.


1. ADD translation process
--------------------------

1.1
---
CONTACT a bashburn developer and tell what you want translate. He will do the
necessary things to provide you a language directory with different skeleton
files. (Hint: You can also do this by yourself - but you need a little
knowledge of the bashburn translation structure and you should only do this if
you KNOW what you do! Otherwise you may "damage" all other translations!)


1.2
---
Edit with a text editor the file "TRANSLATOR" in the language directory of the
language you want to translate and encode it in unicode UTF8. It contains 4
lines which you should correctly edit:

  FIRST NAME: Name
  SURNAME   : Another_name
  E-MAIL    : mymail@xy.loc
  EXIT-DATE : ?

The first lines should be clear.
The "EXIT-DATE" is the date which you know that you can't do the translation
anymore. There are 2 types of this:

  12. August 2009
  ?

-> In the first case you will leave the translation project at 12. August 2009
(please use the shown date-format!).
-> If you don't know a date - just enter '?'. This means you don't plan to exit bashburn
translation now - but you may do it and contact us if you wish so.

This is not to nerve you. This informations help us to ensure good
translations: We can contact you in case of questions and we can welcome
another translator for your language in case you want not do it anymore.

In any case:
- We contact you in case you should update a translation.
- If we don't hear anything from you over a longer period of time AND we have a
new interested translator - this person can starting updating translation. You
will be deleted from TRANSLATOR file (but maybe mentioned in "CREDITS" file).

Now goto description of UPDATE translation (step 2).


2. UPDATE translation process
-----------------------------

2.1
---
You need a (text) editor which supports Unicode UTF8 encoding of the
translation text files. Bashburn translation files must be ENCODED in UTF8 (see
"http://www.utf-8.com/")!

Bashburn uses the GNU "gettext" translation system for translation (see
"http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/"). If you don't know this, you should
read more about it.

Now you can begin to translate the ".po" files in your language directory.
There also graphical programms like "KBabel" which can support you by this step.


2.2
---
After finishing translation and you think all it's done, edit the file
"STATE" in your language directory. Delete the message in it (e.g.):

  "Your language directory need updating translation!"

and write in:

  "UPDATED".

After this, we know that we can use "savely" your translation.


2.3
---
Contact a bashburn developer to complete your translation technically (this
involves creating of ".mo" files and some file coying). (You can do this also
manually with "make MO <language>" and "make install <language>".
